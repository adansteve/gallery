// Changing Image to Google photos to direct link

1) Make a shared album and add a photo to it.
2) Create a shared link of it.
3) Logout or use another browser to open the shared link.
4) Get a link by "Copy image URL" in the right-click menu after expanding view.

You will get the link such as format below (shorter than a link by Rinus)
If you delete a shared folder so a direct link to the photo is deleted too. Last of "=w1236-h825" is size, you can change. If you change it to "=d", it will be original size stored on the cloud (=downloading size).
